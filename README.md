# 📊 BRIMO App Sentiment Analysis Project

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews of the BRIMO mobile banking application.

The main objective is to build a robust classification model that accurately predicts whether a user review is **Positive** or **Negative** based on cleaned and processed textual data.
